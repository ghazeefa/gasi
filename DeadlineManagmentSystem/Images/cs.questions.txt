what are namespaces?
A namespace is just a collection of related classes..
e.g 
system.out.println("paki");
 In this System is a namespace.
            while 
                 .out , .console, .Environment, .Math  are Classes.

what is postfix and prefix?
a++ is postfix while ++a is a prefix.
Difference is that 
if we used int a=10;
console.writeline("value is {0} ,"++a);
output is:
11 because ++ is before a.
        while
same for a++ postfix.
that a=10 then
output is:
10 because a++ means add or equal.
n
what are is and as operators?
is operator returns true if a given object is a certain type.
as operator converts a  given object to another type if possible.

what are ternary operators?
operators like a very similar to if-else statement, sign are ?:

Operators Precedence::
1. Multiplicative * / %
2. Additive + -
3. Comparision adn Type Testing < > <= >= is as
4. Equality == !=
5. Conditional AND &&
6. Conditional OR ||
7. Ternary ?:
8. Assignment = *= /= %= += -=
